## Gameplay

The most important action in this game is **jumping**! The player controls the distance and height of the jump by controlling the length of time the button is held down. There are three modes to choose from, allowing players to take on levels of varying difficulty, hone their skills, or participate in endless score challenges. Players need to jump through portals to switch scenes.
